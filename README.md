# 2048-ish

This is a complete rebuild of the popular, original 2048 game. It is coded entirely from scratch and includes some minor differences in score tallying and tile creation.

## Development

This small project uses Webpack for bundling. To run it locally for development:

1. npm install
2. Run **`npm run serve`**, which will run a webpack-dev-server at `http://localhost:4000/` and watch for changes in `src` directory. This `src` directory contains the `index.html` and other necessary files that are compiled to `dist`.
